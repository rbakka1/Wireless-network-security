# Wireless-network-security
This repository showcases five hands-on projects focused on wireless network security. Each project demonstrates a different aspect of securing wireless networks, from scanning and analyzing traffic to implementing defensive measures and mitigating attacks.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Wireless Network Scanning and Information Gathering
- **Description**: Explored wireless network enumeration using tools like `airmon-ng` and `airodump-ng`. Captured essential details such as SSID, signal strength, and security protocols.
- **Skills Learned**: Network enumeration, wireless traffic analysis, and using Linux-based wireless tools.

### 2. WPA2 Handshake Capture and Analysis
- **Description**: Captured WPA2 handshake packets using `airodump-ng` and analyzed their structure. Prepared the foundation for cryptanalysis and password security evaluation.
- **Skills Learned**: Packet capture, understanding WPA2 authentication mechanisms, and traffic inspection.

### 3. Cracking WPA2 Passwords with Aircrack-ng
- **Description**: Decrypted WPA2 handshakes using wordlist attacks with `aircrack-ng`. Highlighted the importance of using strong, complex passwords.
- **Skills Learned**: Cryptanalysis, password cracking techniques, and ethical hacking practices.

### 4. Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS) Setup
- **Description**: Configured a Wireless Intrusion Detection System with tools like `Kismet`. Monitored wireless activities and flagged potential security breaches.
- **Skills Learned**: IDS setup, wireless network security, and real-time monitoring.

### 5. WiFi Jamming Attack and Mitigation
- **Description**: Simulated WiFi jamming attacks and implemented countermeasures. Developed an understanding of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and their mitigation.
- **Skills Learned**: Offensive wireless security, denial-of-service (DoS) simulation, and defensive strategies.

## Skills and Tools
- **Skills**: Wireless network enumeration, cryptanalysis, intrusion detection, ethical hacking, DoS attack simulation.
- **Tools**: `airmon-ng`, `airodump-ng`, `aircrack-ng`, `aireplay-ng`, `Kismet`.

This repository serves as a demonstration of proficiency in wireless network security and showcases practical implementations of theoretical concepts.
